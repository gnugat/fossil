# sfQuickCommands

Scripts allowing to speed up your workflow/process by running sets of daily
Symfony2 commands (project creation, database re-creation, etc).

## Installation

You should first clone this repository, go inside it
and then run the initialization script:

    git clone git://github.com/gnugat/sfQuickCommands.git
    cd sfQuickCommands
    sh init

The initialization script will download [composer](http://getcomposer.org/)
(the PHP dependency manager), and set the execution rights on the scripts.

## Usage

You can run the scripts from your project directory, except for the one that
creates a new Symfony2 project for which you need to go inside the
sfQuickCommands root directory.

To learn more about the available commands and their usage,
read the [documentation](doc/01-index.md).
