# Introduction

Every Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) should have a good basic
documentation, which:

* introduces the project
* lists its features
* explains how to install it
* encourages people to contribute

The files (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, etc) are always the same, which makes project
creation repetitive. So why not automate this part?

This is what **fossil** is there for: run the command to create all those files
in your brand new project (or in an old one, if you never documented it before).

Now that your project is ready to be started, fossil still can help you by
generating boilerplate code, like for example:

* injecting a dependency (use statement, property, constructor argument, etc)

## The `fossil` name

This project's name comes from the acronym FOSS, and from the fact that
skeletons are used to generate project configuration.

Fossils are usually skeletons, right?
