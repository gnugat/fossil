# Introduction

Every Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) should have a good basic
documentation, which:

* introduces the project
* lists its features
* explains how to install it
* encourages people to contribute

The files (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, etc) are always the same, which makes project
creation repetitive. So why not automate this part?

This is what fossil is there for: run the command to create all those files in
your brand new project (or in an old one, if you never documented it before).

## The `fossil` name

This project's name comes from the acronym FOSS, and from the fact that
skeletons are used to generate project configuration.

Fossils are usually skeletons, right?
